        <ul>
            <li>Summary - <br/>
                I am a PHP Developer that is trying to dive into the world of Web Design which would make me a complete newbie at this.
                I have knowledge of basic ideas but I have been working with PHP and decided that building up on the skills and knowledge
                that I already have would be the best choice to grow and as a developer before branching out into other regions of code.
